# MQTT Broker

An mqtt broker on top of netty, netty.io. This is a very early stage project and should be considered experimental.

The intention is to build a fully async non blocking mqtt server.

## Motivation

Writing network services used to be hard or expensive. Now it is
neither, and this is what I want to demonstrate by publishing the code
of a working broker for the [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) protocol.

Of course, this is not yet a complete implementation of MQTT. It doesn't
include QoS, Last Will and Testament and other feature of the MQTT
protocol. It does, however, show how to write a modern scaleable
service, using Clojure on the JVM.

## Ingredients

* git
* Java Virtual Machine
* [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
* [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
* [mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/)

## Method

```
$ lein repl
$ (go)

```

Open a new terminal and run the following

```
mosquitto_sub -t /test
```

Now open another terminal to publish messages to the broker, seeing them
appear in the other terminal.

```
mosquitto_pub -t /test -m "Hello"
```

## How it works

[config.clj](config.clj) shows you which components make up this system,
including the codec provided by
[clj-mqtt](https://github.com/xively/clj-mqtt).

Jig reads the [config.clj](config.clj) file and instantiates the
components therein. If you have [graphviz]() installed you can type
`(graph)` at the console to view a diagram showing how the components
fit together.

We provide the code to just one of these called `MqttHandler` which injects a
function into the _system map_. (Jig is a bit like an application
container and the 'system map' is an emerging Clojure pattern to collate
application state into a single data structure).

Another component called `jig.netty/Server` is specified here, along
with its port number (1883). This provides a generic adapter for Netty
5 - as such the code for this is in this [Jig extension](). On start up,
this component looks across its dependencies to find the other
components to include in the pipeline that it creates when a client
connects.

`jig.netty.mqtt/MqttEncoder` and `jig.netty.mqtt/MqttDecoder`, are
adapters for the codec code kindly provided by clj-mqtt. This codec
further reduces the Clojure code we must write, since they convert
between low-level Netty byte buffers and convenient Clojure maps.

Each request is handled by  the `case` form, dispatching on the :type value of the map decoded by clj-mqtt :-

```clojure
(case (:type msg)
          :connect (.writeAndFlush ctx {:type :connack})
          :pingreq (.writeAndFlush ctx {:type :pingresp})
          :publish (doseq [ctx (get @subs (:topic msg))]
                     (.writeAndFlush ctx msg))
          :subscribe (do (.writeAndFlush ctx {:type :suback})
                         (swap! subs (fn [subs]
                                       (reduce #(update-in %1 [%2] conj ctx)
                                               subs (map first (:topics msg))))))
          :disconnect (.close ctx))
```

The `:subscribe` handler acknowledges the request and places the context
in the `subs` map, using the topic as the key and a list of subsribers
as the value. You can't mutate maps in Clojure without using its STM and
I've chosen to use an atom. The `:publish` handler looks up the
subscribers based on the topic key and writes out the incoming message
to each of them.

## Caveats

Obviously this implementation is extremely threadbare, but I'm
publishing it now to show the core essence of a broker and as a
foundation on which I and others can build the rest of the MQTT broker
implementation.
